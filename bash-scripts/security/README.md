## Scripts Overview

1. `main.sh`: Provides a menu-driven interface to execute other security management scripts.
2. `security-patch-management.sh`: Manages and applies security patches to the system.
3. `ssh-brute-force-monitor.sh`: Monitors and alerts on potential SSH brute force attacks.
4. `vulnerability-scan.sh`: Performs vulnerability scans on the system.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell environment
- Root or sudo access for security operations
- Basic understanding of system security concepts
- Necessary security tools installed (e.g., vulnerability scanners)

## Usage

To use these security management scripts, navigate to the `automation-scripts/bash-scripts/security/` directory and run the desired script:

1. **Security Patch Management**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./security-patch-management.sh
   ```

2. **SSH Brute Force Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ssh-brute-force-monitor.sh
   ```

3. **Vulnerability Scan**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./vulnerability-scan.sh
   ```

4. **Main Menu**:
   ```bash
   ./main.sh
   ```

## Security Considerations

- `System Impact:` Applying security patches may require system restarts.
- `False Positives:` Be aware that vulnerability scans and brute force detection may produce false positives.
- `Sensitive Data:` Handle scan results and security logs with care, as they may contain sensitive information.

## Troubleshooting

- `Permission Errors:` Ensure you have the necessary permissions (root or sudo) for all security operations.
- `Failed Patches:` If patch application fails, check system logs for details and ensure system compatibility.
- `Scan Errors:` If vulnerability scans fail, verify that all required tools are correctly installed and updated.
