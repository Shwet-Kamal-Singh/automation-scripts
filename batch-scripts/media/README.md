## Automation Considerations

- `File Formats`: Ensure that the scripts support the file formats you intend to work with.
- `Performance`: Be mindful of system resources when processing large media files or batches.

## Troubleshooting

- `Dependency Errors`: Make sure all required tools (e.g., FFmpeg) are installed and properly configured in the system PATH.
- `File Access Issues`: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read/write media files in the specified directories.
- `Execution Errors`: Verify that all paths and configurations in the scripts are correct for your system setup.
